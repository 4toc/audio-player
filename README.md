# audio-player

Vue 3 + TS + Vite.

Audio player that makes music list from config

For testing I add mp3 files to local import because at first I tried write src in config but I had problems with build

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
